1.Generate the following two result sets:
Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.
ANS-
select CONCAT(name,'(',left(occupation,1),')') 
from OCCUPATIONS 
order by name;

select CONCAT('There are a total of',' ',count(occupation),' ',lower(occupation),'s.') 
from OCCUPATIONS 
group by occupation 
order by count(occupation), occupation;

2.ConsiderP1(A,B)  and P2(C,D) to be two points on a 2D plane.

A happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
B happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 C happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 D happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.


ANS-  SELECT CAST (ABS(MAX(LAT_N)  - MIN(LAT_N)) + ABS(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W))as numeric(32,4)) FROM STATION;

3.Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N)
and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

ANS-  SELECT 
      cast(round(SQRT(
             SQUARE((Abs ((MIN(LAT_N ) - MAX(LAT_N )))) )
           + SQUARE( (Abs((MIN(LONG_W  ) - MAX(LONG_W  )))))
            )
        ,4)as decimal(18,4))FROM  STATION;
